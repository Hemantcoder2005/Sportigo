# Sportigo

### Sportigo is a web application designed to streamline sports equipment booking and availability tracking for college students. It aims to solve the common problem of students traveling to the sports block only to find their desired sport already taken. With Sportigo, students can check real-time availability, book equipment, and ensure the security of sports gear.

## Features

1. *Live Availability Tracking*:
   - Students can view the availability status of various sports and equipment online.
   - Real-time updates ensure accurate information.

2. *Equipment Booking*:
   - Users can reserve specific sports equipment through the platform.
   - Booking slots are time-bound to prevent conflicts.

3. *Secure Sign-Out Process*:
   - When returning equipment, students must sign out to verify the return.
   - This enhances security and accountability.
